# Application-Automation-using-Hand-Gestures
To help the disabled, elderly and children communicate with the devices directly through gestures instead of the conventional switchboards we propose a system to make human hand tracking and controlling the household appliances possible in real time with minimal latency.
Our designed system in its first stage i.e. Recognition stage, captures the image. It will process the captured image and compare it with the database images. Each database image will be set to the command interface mode. If a particular image is identified then a command will be sent to the microcontroller. In its second stage the microcontroller will identify the command and send a signal to the reference port for operation.
This project mainly consists of a Hand Gesture Recognition section and a Control hub section. The hand gesture recognition section consists of a microcontroller and a transmitter. The control hub consists of a receiver, a microcontroller, a relay switch and a Bluetooth module.
